# Broker Trading Barometer

## Overview

Broker Trading Barometer is an interactive dashboard prototype developed in Streamlit to explore trading behavior and broker activity patterns.
The application was designed as a mockup to support discussions with consulting firms about future report automation and data visualization strategies.
All visuals and insights are based on synthetic datasets created solely for demonstration purposes.

## Context and Requirements

This project was structured through a requirement-gathering process with the executive team, aiming to design an analytical tool that integrates market dynamics and internal trading data into a unified interface.

Key objectives included:

- Centralizing broker activity and company trading indicators.

- Exploring metrics such as short interest, buy/sell behavior, and custody positions.

- Building modular analytical sections that allow multi-angle exploration of market behavior.

## Dashboard Sections

- Company View	Aggregated overview of trading activity at the company level.
- Short Interest	Visualization of short interest trends and historical peaks.
- General Profile	Summary of broker or investor profiles, including performance and share distribution.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

The dataset used in this mockup was carefully constructed from synthetic and anonymized data, designed to emulate real-world trading patterns.
Certain broker and company names intentionally blend realistic and fictional references to create a more authentic visualization experience — but none of the data reflect actual market records.
